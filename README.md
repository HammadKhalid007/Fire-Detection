Fire Detection and Localization

Project Overview:
The Fire Detection and Localization project is a cutting-edge computer vision application designed to detect and localize fire using advanced algorithms. Leveraging the power of pre-trained YOLO_v5, the model has been further trained on an extensive dataset of 8000 fire and smoke images, resulting in a highly accurate and reliable fire detection system.

Key Features:
State-of-the-Art Detection: The YOLO_v5 model has been fine-tuned to achieve exceptional accuracy in identifying fire and smoke patterns, making it a robust solution for real-world fire detection scenarios.

Deployment-Ready Model: The trained YOLO_v5 model is readily available for use, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate it into their applications without the need for extensive training.

Desktop Application: The project includes a user-friendly desktop application that provides a clear visualization of fire detection results, making it accessible and easy to use for non-technical users.

Real-Time Performance: The model's real-time capabilities enable swift fire detection, reducing response time and enhancing safety measures in critical situations.

Open-Source Contribution: We encourage contributions from the open-source community to enhance the model's performance and expand its applications to various industries and domains.

How to Use:
Launch the Fire Detection and Localization desktop application.
Upload an image or stream from a video source for fire detection.
The application will promptly display the detected fire and smoke regions with bounding boxes, allowing users to take appropriate actions.
Project Structure:
The project is organized into two main parts:

Model Training: The process of fine-tuning the pre-trained YOLO_v5 model on a carefully curated dataset of 8000 fire and smoke images.
Deployment: The development of a user-friendly desktop application for real-time fire detection using the trained model.
Technologies Used:
YOLO_v5: Pre-trained model for fire detection.
Python: Backend code for model training and application development.
PyQt: Framework for creating a user-friendly desktop application.
OpenCV: Library for image and video processing.
How to Contribute:
We welcome contributions from the open-source community to enhance the model's performance and extend its capabilities. Whether you are an experienced computer vision expert or an enthusiastic developer, your contributions can make a significant impact on fire safety and detection.

Acknowledgments:
We extend our gratitude to the YOLOv5 community for their exceptional work in computer vision. Special thanks to all the contributors who helped curate the dataset and improve the model's performance.
