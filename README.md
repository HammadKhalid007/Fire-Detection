# Fire-Detection
It's a fire detection and localization project which focuses on the detection of fire making use of computer vision algorithms.
The project consist of a pre-trained yolo_v5 model which was further trained on 8000 images of fire and smoke. The final model is shared and can be used directly. 
The project has 2 parts: one is the training of the model and the second is the deployment of the model in an application. Below is how the desktop application looks like.
